## District-and-Taluka-Level-Medium-Range-Weather-Forecast-Verification-of-IMD-Data for Anand District, Gujarat
# Weather forecast verification is an important process that evaluates the accuracy and reliability of weather predictions. This is done by comparing the forecasted weather conditions with the actual observed weather conditions over a certain time period. Through verification, forecasters can assess the performance of different forecasting models and techniques, identify strengths and weaknesses, and improve the overall accuracy of future forecasts.
# I analysed the forecast verification based on following verification metrices - 
# 1) Ratio Score
# 2) HK Score(Hanssen and Kuipers index, peirceâ€™s skill score)
# 3) Threat Score(critical success index)
# 4) RMSE(Root mean squared error)
# 5) Correct, usable or unusable forecast
